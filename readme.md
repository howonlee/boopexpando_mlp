Expando MLP (or: Poking At Causation, part 3a / 3)
===

Read my [thoughts about causation](http://howonlee.github.io/2016/01/21/Poking-20At-20Causation1.html) to see the inspiration.

I repeat from Koenig and Moo's [great C++ text](http://www.amazon.com/Accelerated-C-Practical-Programming-Example/dp/020170353X) an anecdote about telescope lenses. It is said to be faster to grind a 3-inch lens and _then_ to grind a 6-inch lens than to start off grinding a 6-inch lens. This is because you get over the many pitfalls of the lense-grinding process when you can afford to make lots of mistakes. This is, basically, an algorithmic multilayer perceptron version of this.

The next step, obviously, is to generalize to tensors and do this with RNN's.
